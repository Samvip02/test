 Server-Side Transcription with Whisper
Since OpenAI doesn't provide an API for Whisper, you can run Whisper locally or on a server where you have access to a machine with the required hardware (CPU/GPU) and software environment. Here's an outline:

Setting Up Whisper Locally or on a Server
Install Whisper: Follow the installation instructions from the Whisper GitHub repository.

Create a Transcription API Endpoint: Set up an API endpoint on your server to accept audio files and run Whisper for transcription.

Example Backend Script (using Python with Flask)......i've added rhid part in the python code



Backend:

Install necessary Python packages: flask, whisper, openai.

Replace 'your_openai_api_key' with your actual OpenAI API key.

Ensure the uploads directory is present for storing temporary audio files.

Frontend:

Replace 'https://your-backend-url/transcribe' with the actual URL where your Flask server is hosted.
